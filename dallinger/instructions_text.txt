-- -- -- -- Condition 1 - Looking for underwater gold -- -- -- -- --
-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --- -- -- --

-- -- -- -- -- -- -- Page 1 -- -- -- -- -- -- --
You work for a company looking for underwater gold. 
You will observe areas briefly and decide if the area has more water or more gold. 
An area has more gold if there are more yellow dots than blue, and more water if there are more blue dots than yellow.
Note that the size of the dots does not matter, only the number. Don't bother trying to count the 
dots — they will appear too briefly for that. Instead, you should take your best guess.

-- -- -- -- -- -- -- Page 2 -- -- -- -- -- -- --
You have already been paid $0.25 as a salary.
On each round, you will get a $0.20 bonus if you are correct in judging the area as containing more gold or more water.
In addition to this accuracy bonus, you will be paid $0.005 for every gold deposit (yellow dot) in the area, 
regardless of the size of the deposit. Because the gold will always be collected, you will get this bonus 
regardless of whether you are correct in judging the area as containing more gold or more water.

For example, this area contains 50 gold deposits. If you answer correctly that there is 
more gold than water, you will get a $0.20 accuracy bonus, plus a $0.005 bonus for all 
50 gold deposits. In total, your bonus from the round will be $0.45.

-- -- -- -- -- -- -- Page 4 -- -- -- -- -- -- --
If you answer incorrectly that there is more water than gold, you will not get 
an accuracy bonus, but you will still get a $0.005 bonus for all 50 gold deposits. In this case, your bonus from the round will be $0.25.

There are 12 rounds in total. The first 2 are practice rounds. For each area, your bonus will be rounded to the 
nearest cent and shown to you. The practice rounds will not affect your bonus. 
Also note that if you leave the experiment early, you will not recieve any bonus.
Each area is different from the others - just because there was more gold in one 
area does not mean there will be more in the next area.

-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --- -- -- --

-- -- -- -- -- -- -- Page 1 -- -- -- -- -- -- --
You work for a company looking for water in a desert area. You will observe areas briefly and 
decide if the area has more water or more sand. An area has more water if there are more blue dots 
than yellow, and more sand if there are more yellow dots than blue. Note that the size of the dots 
does not matter, only the number. Don't bother trying to count the dots — they will appear too briefly for that. 
Instead, you should take your best guess.

For example, this area contains 30 water deposits. If you answer correctly that there is 
more sand than water, you will get a $0.20 accuracy bonus, plus a $0.005 bonus for all 
30 water deposits. In total, your bonus from the round will be $0.35.

-- -- -- -- -- -- -- Page 4 -- -- -- -- -- -- --
If you answer incorrectly that there is more water than sand, you will not get an accuracy bonus, 
but you will still get a $0.005 bonus for all 30 water deposits. In this case, your bonus from 
the round will be $0.15.

-- -- -- -- -- -- -- Page 1 -- -- -- -- -- -- --
You work for a company cleaning a chemical recently spilled in a protected ocean zone. 
You will observe areas briefly and decide if the areas contain more chemical or more water. 
An areas has more chemical if there are more yellow dots than blue, and more water if there 
are more blue dots than yellow. Note that the size of the dots does not matter, only the number. 
Don't bother trying to count the dots — they will appear too briefly for that.

You have already been paid $4.00 to clean the spill. On each round 
you will get a $0.20 bonus if you are correct in judging the area as containing more 
chemical or more water.In addition to this accuracy bonus, however, you need to spend 
$0.005 to clean every chemical spill (yellow dot), regardless of the size of this spill. 
Because all the chemical needs to be cleaned, you will pay this cost regardless of whether 
you are correct in judging the area as containing more chemical or more water.

For example, this area contains 50 chemical spills. If you answer correctly that there is 
more chemical than water, you will get a $0.20 accuracy bonus. However, you must also pay 
a $0.005 fee for all 50 chemical spills. In total, you will lose $0.05 on this round.
