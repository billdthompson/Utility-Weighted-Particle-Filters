        <hr>

        <p> You work for a company cleaning a chemical recently spilled in a protected desert zone. 
                You will observe areas briefly and decide if the areas contain more chemical or more sand. 
                An areas has more chemical if there are more blue dots than yellow, and more sand if there 
                are more yellow dots than blue.  <b>Note that the size of the dots does not matter, only the number. </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            You have already been paid <b>$5.00</b> to clean the spill. On each round 
            you will get a <b>$0.05</b> bonus if you are correct, and will spend <b>$0.10</b> 
            to clean the area if it has more chemical than sand. You do not need to spend 
            money to clean areas with more sand than chemical. Don't bother trying to count 
            the dots â€” they will appear too briefly for that. 
            Instead, you should take your best guess.</p>

        <p>Here is an example of what you might see:</p>
        <div class="center_div">
            <img class="stimulus_image" src="/static/images/demo.jpg" width="400" alt=""/>
        </div>
        <p>In this image, there is more sand than chemical. Regardless of your judgement, you will not spend
            any money to clean this area.
        </p>
