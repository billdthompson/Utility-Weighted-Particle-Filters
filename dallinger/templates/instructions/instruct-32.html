            You have already been paid $0.25 as a salary.
            On each round, you will get a $0.05 bonus if 
            you are correct. Also, if there area has more water than sand, the company will be a well on this site 
            and you will get an additional bonus of $0.10. The company will not build a well if there is more sand than water. </p>
            <p>
            Don't bother trying to count the dots â€” they will appear too briefly for that. 
            Instead, you should take your best guess.</p>
