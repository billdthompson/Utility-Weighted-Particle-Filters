        <p> Your job at the company is to explore gold deposits. 
            You will observe areas only briefly and decide if the area is good or bad. 
            Each area has black circles of dirt and yellow circles of gold. 
            An area is good if there is more gold than dirt, and bad if there is more dirt than gold.
            For each area you get a $0.25 bonus if you are correct. 
            Also, if the area has more gold than dirt, you and all employees
            get an additional $0.25 bonus from the company's profits.</p>
