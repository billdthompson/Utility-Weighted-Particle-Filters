        <p>
            You have already been paid $0.25 as a salary.
            On each round, you will get a $0.05 bonus if 
            you are correct, as well as additional $0.10 bonus from the company's profits if the area has 
            more gold than water. You will not get any bonus if the area has more water than gold. </p>
            <p>
            Don't bother trying to count the dots â€” they will appear too briefly for that. 
            Instead, you should take your best guess.
