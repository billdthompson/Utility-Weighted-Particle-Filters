        <p> You work for a company extracting natural resources from unexplored areas. For your work, you will have to decide
            whether there are more black dots or yellow dots. On each round, you will get a bonus if 
            you are correct, as well as possible additional bonus depending on your job at the company. 
            Don't bother trying to count the dots â€” they will appear too briefly for that. Instead, you should take your best guess.</p>

        <p>Here is an example of what you might see:</p>
        <div class="center_div">
            <img class="stimulus_image" src="/static/images/demo.jpg" width="400" alt=""/>
        </div>
        <p>In this image, there are more yellow dots than blue dots.</p>
