            You have already been paid $5.00 to clean the spill. On each round 
            you will get a 0.05 bonus if you are correct, and will spend $0.10 
            to clean the area if it has more chemical than sand. You do not need to spend 
            money to clean areas with more sand than chemical. </p>
            <p>Don't bother trying to count 
            the dots â€” they will appear too briefly for that. 
            Instead, you should take your best guess.</p>
